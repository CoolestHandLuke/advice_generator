## My process

### Built with

-   Vite
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   fetch API
-   adviceslip API
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at using Vite and React in a project, as well as parsing data from an external API using fetch. This project helped to serve as a confidence booster as I was able to make something actually work using React.
